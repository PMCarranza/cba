# **COMMUNITY BREAKFAST ON AURORA**
Sign Up App


# **Description**
This app was born out of the need to keep track of the increasing number of volunteers interested in serving coffee and treats to clients of The Therapeutic Health Services clinic https://ths-wa.org/ths-locations/ths-shoreline-branch/

The app allows volunteers to sign up for a tuesday of their choosing on any given month.

## **Usage**

Once the volunteers have reached the page https://pmcarranza.github.io/cba/ they enter their name, choose a tuesday from a drop down with 4 options, if the choose to provide something for the day selected after selecting 'Yes' the form will appear and they can type what will be provided; after submiting their name will appear on the table corresponding to their tuesday choice along with what they are providing (if 'Yes' was chosen).

Among the key features you will find that Firebase is used to store the name of the volunteer, the tuesday they want to serve and what they are providing.
jQuery handles the table population, moment.js updates the next serving date; after each tuesday of the month its corresponding table clears the information and is ready for the next time it is called upon.

## **Roadmap**

I think it can be used in a more widespread manner within the church since a few tweaks can make it suitable for other ministries as well.
